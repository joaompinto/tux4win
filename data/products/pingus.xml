	The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and has
	to guide them through levels. Since the animals walk on their own, the 
	player can only influence them by giving them commands, like build a
	bridge, dig a hole or redirect all animals in the other direction.
	The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for this multiple combination
	of commands are necessary.
